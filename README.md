# Formula One Race Strategy
## Objective
Find the best tire strategy: When to pit and which compounds to use.
This can depend on Objectives. Overall goal is to finish highest in the standings. What this really means canv vary:
1. Getting the most points -> Finishing in the best place -> Having the fastest overall race time
2. Getting the most points -> Finishing in the best place -> Finishing ahead of the most cars even if race time is slower
3. Maximizing point differential between you and closest rivals -> Finishing as far ahead of them as possible

Current strategy focus: Find optimal strategy to minimize total race time not considering game theory (response to opponent's strategy)
